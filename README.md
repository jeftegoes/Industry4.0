## 1.1. Digitisation

- Digitisation is converting analog information into digital so that computers can store, process, and transmit it.

## 1.2. Digitalization

- Refers to the trend of adoption of digital technology by individuals and companies for perceived benefits.
- It can help provide new revenue generating or cost reduction opportunities for companies and influence social interactions or provide convenience for individuals and society.

### 1.2.1. Consumer perspective

## 1.3. Digital Transformation

- Digital Transformation is the sustainable value creation across the whole ecosystem of an organization including employees, customers and partners by adopting digital technologies at scale and driving permanent change in the organization culture.

## 1.5. Industrial Revolution

### 1.5.1. First Industrial Revolution

- At the end of 18th century, there was the invention of water and steam engine, and this was used for **mechanical production** before that.
- All the industrial work used to be mostly manual and hand driven, and this was called as the first industrial revolution of mechanization with the invention of mechanical loom.

### 1.5.2. Second Industrial Revolution

- Then came electricity and the concept of mass production.
- So this was referred to as the **Second Industrial Revolution** around 1870.

### 1.5.3. Third Industrial Revolution

- And then there was the advancement of electronics computers and also translated into manufacturing and production facilities, which was called automation, or the **Third Industrial Revolution**.
- So controllers or the programmable logic controllers were commonly used at that time to automate the way plants and industrial machinery work.

### 1.5.4. Fourth Industrial Revolution

- Now the fourth Industrial Revolution talks about how digital and physical systems interact with each other.
- It refers to the current and developing environment in which digital technologies are changing the way we live and work.
- More commonly used in industrial and operational context.

- Fourth, Industrial Revolution has really picked up over the last few years is because of four developments or drivers, as you can see on the right hand side.

1. The advancement of these technologies like artificial intelligence, 3D printing, robotics, which gives us newer ways of working and creating benefits and impact for companies.
2. Ability to add sensors because of the lower cost, which means you can read data from machines, and using that data, you can make the machines talk to each other, or you can act between human and machines because you have a common source of data to measure.
3. Data analysis.
4. Data storage.

- So because of the advancement of these technologies, because of the decrease in cost of, for example, of sensors for storing the data, the fourth industrial revolution now is really in full flow and set up for a very disruptive change in our times to come.
